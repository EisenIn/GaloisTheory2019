# Galois Theory

This repository contains the latex sources of the lecture notes of my course on Galois Theory 

# Creating a PDF file

I am not publishing the pdf-file of the lecture notes. Instead I recommend to use git-features to keep up to date and to participate. For a newcomer to GitHub, it might be a good idea to install the GitHub desktop https://desktop.github.com/ first and clone this repository with the GitHub desktop. Then, proceed by going through the tutorial on GitHub desktop. If you want to suggest some changes to the lecture notes, please create n new branch, edit the files in there and send a pull request that is then open for discussion. 

To compile the latex sources, install LaTeX, for example from the official webpage of the latex project http://www.latex-project.org/ and _latex_ the file notes.tex . If you want a correct bibliography, you should also run _bibtex_ on notes.tex .
